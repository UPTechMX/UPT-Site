# Urban Performance
The Urban Performance tool assesses the city's present and future performance by modeling investment projects or policies in a range of indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including aspects such as poverty reduction, water management, energy, infrastructure, public transportation, climate action, etc. Urban Performance models multiple scenarios and spatial solutions to test the effectiveness of their contributions to sustainable development. Scenarios
can serve as a dialog platform between stakeholders, who can use them to assess synergies between initiatives, to develop integrated solutions, to understand interdependency of possible solutions, and/or to create a multilevel and multisectoral consensus, among others. The tool is able to support decision making for preparation and evaluation of RTR (spatial plans).
