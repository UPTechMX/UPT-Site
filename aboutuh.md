## Urban Hotspots
The Urban Planning Tool Urban Hotspots identifies optimal locations within a city for a specific activity by evaluating proximity between urban facilities and inhabitants, at local/ neighborhood /city levels across the metro. It includes two search functionalities, the layer, and the filter, which correspond to indicators, planning standards, and national government’s norms essential for spatial planning (population, employment, density, land use, etc.). These functionalities grant flexibility to decision-makers, to explore multiple combinations of urban spatial planning parameters that capture and respond to the city’s needs and challenges.

Urban Hotspots is a web application that uses multicriteria analysis techniques for agile spatial analysis. With Urban Hotspots, users can create heat maps of access to urban services within minutes or find optimal locations for a specific activity within a city.
